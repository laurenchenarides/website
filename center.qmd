## Mission

The **Colorado Center for Food Innovation (CCFI)** is a new multidisciplinary consortium working to remove barriers that prevent next-generation food products from reaching the market.

We integrate **data-driven research**, **targeted policy advocacy**, and **high-impact industry partnerships** to ensure innovations translate directly from the lab to commercial and widespread home adoption.

## Vision

To build a **resilient food system** that links farmers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to scale sustainable innovation benefiting both producers and consumers.


## Who We Are

We are a multidisciplinary research consortium combining expertise in **food science**, **engineering**, and **consumer economics**.  

Our work advances research and application to address supply chain challenges and develop scalable, evidence-based food system solutions.


## The Problem

Despite rapid innovation, many next-generation sustainable foods—particularly **plant-based and hybrid meat alternatives**—fail to achieve wide consumer adoption.  

The barriers extend beyond technology to include:

- Poor culinary performance in common home appliances  
- Psychological resistance to new foods and technologies  
- Gaps between policy support and market incentives  
- Limited technical workforce to sustain growth


## Strategic Goals

1. **Solve for Consumer Compliance**  
   Develop formulations and processing methods that ensure new foods perform flawlessly in home appliances (microwaves, air fryers) to drive repeat purchases.

2. **Bridge the Policy-to-Market Gap**  
   Generate actionable, data-driven policy and economic insights to unlock state funding, expand market access, and remove legislative and financial barriers that limit food innovation.

3. **Accelerate High-Growth Markets**  
   Focus research and industry partnerships on urgent, high-value opportunities, such as high-protein foods for the GLP-1 consumer segment.

4. **Build a Skilled Workforce**  
   Create specialized training programs that address the technical and analytical needs of rapidly scaling next-generation food companies.


## The Solution

**Integrated, Cross-Disciplinary Research**

By combining methods and perspectives from food science, engineering, and consumer economics, we develop comprehensive solutions that are both innovative and immediately applicable.  

Our work translates innovations from the **lab to commercial production** and **widespread home adoption**.


## The Impact

Our interdisciplinary research drives workforce development, fosters economic growth, and strengthens the food system through measurable consumer compliance (repeat purchases) and evidence-based solutions.
