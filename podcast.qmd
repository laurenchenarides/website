Welcome to *Rooted: Stories of Entrepreneurship in Agribusiness*, a podcast from Colorado State University’s Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics. 

In this podcast series, we explore stories of how people across the food and agriculture industry identify problems, create solutions, and build or improve businesses that make an impact.

What makes *Rooted* unique is that each episode is co-hosted by students in the Agribusiness Entrepreneurship course, who bring their own curiosity and questions to the table. 

Their conversations with leaders across food and agriculture are a chance to learn, reflect, and share those insights with you, our audience of students, entrepreneurs, and changemakers in food and agriculture. 

I appreciate your time and attention, and I’m excited to share these inspiring stories with you!
